* Improvements
** Pile?
What should happen with discarded cards? Should the 'deck' keep track
of them of should it be the responsibility of the user of the deck?
** Return cards to the deck
It must be possible to put cards back
** Sub decks?
Should you be able to divide the deck in N pieces from the same deck,
and should deckerl keep track of this?
Scenario: You divide the deck in two, and two players use each half
by drawing, putting back cards.
